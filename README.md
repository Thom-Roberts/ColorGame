# ColorGame

## Background

I made this game as part of my Traditional Game Development class. I was given a week to create a game that demonstrated some of the basic skills that were taught as an intro to the Unity game engine. These included:

  1. A controllable character (one that can move around).
  2. Environmental challenges (platforming, enemies, etc.)
  3. Win and/or Fail condition
  4. PLayer feedback, such as sound effects, particle effects, and user interface elements.
  5. Two 2D assets and 2 3D assets. 
  6. An added game mechanic (health, shooting, etc.)
  7. Additional gameplay challenges.
  
## My game

I wanted to play around with coloring shaders and moving to set positions on a map. I also wanted to develop a simple AI. So I decided to make a game where the player moves around and tries to color the majority of the map their color. At set intervals a number of platforms will shift their height up or down, potentially blocking player's movements.
